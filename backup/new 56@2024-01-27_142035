You can do this. Define two 270 minutes of timer block. One which would be important is when you will work on the 
defined task in your toDoList of the day. And another is when you will work on non toDoList items. Same thing you 
can have two different rows in your timesheet for 270 minutes block. This is enure if you're focucing on your 
goals or going aimlessly. As per the rule of "Something is better than nothing.", it is okay if you're not 
interest to work on the defined task for any given day and you choose to work on any other task of your interest
at that point of time or even that day. Because you choose not to waste those precious minutes of your day or life. 
But don't do it to often, otherwise you will not be able to achive your goal in SMART way, where T stands for Time bound manner.

270 minutes (toDoList-work(work1/work2 (if weekend or holiday(s))/Learning (if under defined or decided max learning minutes per day)))
270 minutes (non-toDoList work(work1/work2 (if weekend or holiday(s)/Learning (if anything outside defined or decided max learning minutes per day)))

Remember both of these are okay, one will take you to your goal on time, one will also take you to your goal but without any mesaurable time. But 
still it better to do something, than not doing anythig at all. Atleast you will reach your goal (if not today, than tomorrow).
