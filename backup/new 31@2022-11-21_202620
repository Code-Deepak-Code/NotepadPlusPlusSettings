It deploys, manages and scales webapps and services automatically
It leverage
EC2,
S3,
SNS,
Elastic Load balancing and
Auto Scalling

setup :
Use AWS managment console, cmd interface or API.
- Choose platform
- EC2 instance type
- Additonal resources to use
  Such as Amazon Relatation database service or Amazon relationsl VPC
  Then upload the code.
  It will handle the rest of the deployment details such as
  Provisioning, Load balancing, Auto scaling and application health monitoring
  
VPC - Private network to deploy your resources.
It's a regional resource. which means if we have two regiions then we will have a two seperate vpc.

Subnet - Partition your newtok inside VPC. For instance you can partition your vpc into say 2 subnets. One subnet you can make as public whereas onther can be private subnet.
Public subnet can be accessed by www. Private subnet cannot be accessed via www/internet.

Similar to data flow in programming. We have to define network between different subnets. That can be done using Route tables.
