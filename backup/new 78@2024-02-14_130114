What's your expectation?

Based on my experience, knowledge, skill sets and certifications, and the value I believe I can bring to TCS, I would like to propose a fixed component of 24 lakhs per annum. I'm open to discussing the variable component and would welcome your input on how we can structure it to align with the company's objectives and my performance.

HR: I understand. While we do offer competitive compensation packages, I'll need to check if we can accommodate your request.

You: Certainly. I want to highlight that with nearly 8 years of experience in Java, I bring a strong foundation and a diverse skill set to the table. Additionally, I'm committed to further upgrading my skills, particularly in full-stack development, which aligns with TCS's focus on innovation and technology.

HR: That's commendable. We value your experience and expertise. However, I must mention that our standard salary ranges may not always align exactly with individual expectations. Could you consider a slightly lower figure?

You: I appreciate your consideration. My expectations are based on my market research and the value I believe I can bring to TCS. Considering the current industry trends and my career aspirations, I would be comfortable with a package of 23.6 lakhs per annum.

if Hr tries to go further below 23.5 lpa
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HR: That would be too much, how much further you can go down?

You: I understand your position, and I appreciate your candidness or openness. 
However, based on my assessment of the market and my experience, 

I believe 23.6 lakhs per annum is a fair reflection of my expertiese, cloud certifications and the current industry standards. 
Could you please tell me, if there are alternative benefits (like additioanal perks) we can explore, I'm open to discussing them.

Financial benefits:
	1. Sign-on bonus: Depending on your experience and criticality to the role, negotiate for a one-time sign-on bonus upon joining.
	
	2. Company stock options: If applicable to your role, explore the possibility of negotiating for stock options or employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs).
	
	If this doesn't goes, then throw below cards.
		
		1. Relocation assistance: If relocating for the job, discuss covering expenses like moving costs, temporary accommodation, or settling-in allowance.
		
		2. Health insurance: Negotiate for enhanced health insurance coverage for yourself and dependents, including wider hospital network access or higher coverage limits.

Some other tips for negotiation:
	Prioritize: Identify the perks most valuable to you and focus your negotiation efforts on those.
	
	Do your research: Understand the existing TCS benefits structure and industry benchmarks for similar roles before negotiating.
	
	Be reasonable: Don't make unrealistic demands, and present your requests with justification and data.
	
	Maintain a positive tone: Negotiation should be collaborative, not confrontational. Be respectful and open to compromise.
	
	Very Important tips:
	At the end of the day, even if you are able to increase even 5k or even 10k out of whatever the final salary upon which hr is aggreing to,
	You can think your negotiation to be a success. And even 5k or 10k matters as it can pay you car repair bill or petrol etc. This is also 
	based on the principel of something is better than nothing.
	
	2nd round:
	I appreciate the offer the offer given. However, right now I am living in my howetown tier 3 city, with my family. I don't have to pay for rent or food seperately. Based on my experience, skills, and the cost of living in another city which I will have to incur.
	I was hoping for something closer to my expected range. I would like to propose an updated figure, which is 23.6 lpa as fixed. I believe this figure aligns with industry.
	
	If still he says not possible.
	You: would it be possible to have another round of salary discussion, perhaps with input from the project or your team members.
	
	If he says, okay then let him disuccss again. Then return back. He will come up with some lower figure.
	HR: That would be too much, how much further you can go down?

	You: I understand your position, and I appreciate your candidness or openness.
