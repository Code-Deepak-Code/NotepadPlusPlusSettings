Steps :
Start making a habit of sitting for 30 mins straight or in one go. You can use a pomodoro timer or a stop watch if pomodoro is not available.
On the same day. Take a break. And then again sit for 30 mins. Then again take some break then again sit for 30 mins. Again take some break and again sit for 30 mins. Upto now you have sitted for 120 mins or 4 sprints of 30 mins each in a day.

Do the above activity for 3 days and observe. Because the third day will be the hardest as per 14 days principle. Stay persistent and overcome it.

Then continue doing this for the next 4 days. Now you have been doing this for 7 days.

Now is the time to increase the pace a little bit. So now sit for 45 mins in one sprint instead of 30 mins. Do this for 7 days. Now you have been sitting for 180 mins for 2 weeks. So your sprint capacity also increases and your overall min also increases.

Wonderful to do this (sitting for 180 mins in a 45 mins sprint) for 1 week more.

Now you just need two more sprints to achieve your floor target of 270 mins.

Now increase one more sprint in a day. Do this for 2 more weeks taking into account the 14 days principle.

Now increase one more sprint in a day. Do this for 2 more weeks taking into account the 14 days principle.

Wonderful!!! You have achieved your first milestone. And now you have developed a very good habit of yours. Keep this habit preserved because we know that the Good habits are hard to develop but easier to forgo, on the other hand bad habits are easy to develop and hard to forgo.

Now increase one more sprint in a day. Do this for 2 more weeks as per 14 days principle. Do this for 2 more weeks. And keep going.

Mention it - 
Be thoughtful in your approach - said by Rajesh Jatav from ABM. Know know the real meaing of it and how to implement this in an effective manner (jotting down you plan in an excel/notepad because of human tendency of retaining the info or idea for shorter duration / forgetting the things quickly) with Priya Krishnadasan. Also have seen this.

I think it's alrady written in coding related docs but verify once - Always have one eye in you editor and one eye on console / logs. Because logs tells a lot of stories about what's going on and can help us on many ways.

Under three quarter rule, mention :

1st quarter - MOst productive (Get the most of your working hours target done in this. So try to start as early as 7 am or 8 am in the morning and try to cover/complete maximum hour goal (atleast 3 hourss) towards your main work in work1 / work2 (which kind of all of it the main work).
2nd quarter - Less productive
3rd quarter - least productive

Under productivity tips :
You are the morning person - As a human behaviro we know Sun give us energy. The places where they get less sunlight they feel very lethargic, fatigue and of less energy throught he day (accepted by the Nordiac youtuber wheerein one of her video she has accepted that they fell as such during winter when they get only 1 hour of sungligt for the entire day).
So we must try to use the three quarter rule and as per proritiy (1st quater -> 2nd quarter -> 3rd quarter).

Try to finish all your main work in work1 and work2 which has all the work under the category of main work only, on/before 8 pm. Because after that you will have less energy, you will be less productive.
