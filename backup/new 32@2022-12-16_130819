Use Background music without lyrics for the time when youâ€™re watching any tutorials videos or doing reading - This way it will make you more engaging in that video and it will also remove boredom. Sometimes you need to go through documents such as official documents, websites reading, reading hardcopy books etc. Then at times having a background music can help remove your boredom.
You can use lofi beats etc. It is also a part of my time pocket.
