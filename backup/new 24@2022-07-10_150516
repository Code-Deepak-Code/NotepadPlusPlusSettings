In work while maven jars downloading or eclipse is stuck, inbetween you can do other tasks such as coding/checking mails etc, instead of just sitting and watching eclipse getting unstuck.

Don't ever say to someone or meeting that did you understandin what I ma saying or hope that make sense? You can say hope my point is clear at the end of the convesation ( it's a better and fancy way).

If you have to ask any questions then ask in a this priority or order :-
In the meeting most of the persons are generally oblivious of the actual meeting conversation or idea. Your goal will be to maintain their state of mind and let them remain oblivious as much as you could. Because Knowledge is the power in IT and in you team. If you hold more knowledge then you will remain powerful.
For that you can use below steps while asking any questions.
1. First ask  in a clever way.
2. If you are not getting any option then say in little bit naive way.
3. Even point doesn't work the you can say in more naive way.

	Have to make a habit of sitting for long hours atleast for 2 to 3 hours in software enginerring job and jobs like these, only then a good amount of work can be done.
	That is okay. In order to balance this, you must try to do intense workout (15 - 20 minutes) in the evening and after doing that intense workout you should try to get rejunvate as soon as possible because only then you'll be able to foucus on your work straight away.
	
	Second thing is to take a quick 15 to 20 mins afternoon nap in order to active more productivity. Put this uder productivity section.

	upto yesterday there was not any tickets except 1 ticket which I unlocked for the Tony to process.
	Am checking it today in attended mode and also each and every step of the bot. 
	I found out that there's one step which was working fine in previous machine but not on this one.
	But that is a minor issue only. I am using a workaround to get over that as of now.
	But working on that to get the permannant fix on that.
	
	Need production code in development first and then will work on dev env rather than working on  prod directly.
	I checked with the support team, they are saying that we can move the code to dev to prod but not the other way round.
	So only solution left is to do the manual changes in dev. It will be useful also in case if we need to add any new feature to the bot in future.
	Plus as the Ravi told for the notification part.
