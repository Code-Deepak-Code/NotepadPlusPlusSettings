I have moved the head to commit id a6b1003, but want to find the commit id after head, i.e. 0cc5f9f. how can I do so


yesterday I brushed up all the jpa concepts.
I tried to cover the gen ai course, but it's showing as already complted.
So I went through another ai/ml material from the portal.

today I will go through git and some of the modern java concepts.

youcan change you commit history after the fact - ask chatgpt what does thie after the fact.
how far back in time or how far back you wanna go.

Interactive rebase:
	git rebase -i HEAD~3
