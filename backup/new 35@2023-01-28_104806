The course is good for people starting out at a beginner level. But I wanted more advanced level stuffs on Junit

Start early and finish early!
Start by 8 am and Final time sheet submission is 8 pm.
It doesn't mean if you don't then you won't be able to achieve but 8 pm is the final time to submit the timesheet.
