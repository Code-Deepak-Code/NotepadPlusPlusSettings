I totally lost it today Bigtime. What's the meaning of this?

I'm a one of the manager of the corporate IT softwre firm.
If I'm attending any meeting with a cross functional team of whose I'm the one of the manager
My boss is also present in the same meeting. After finishing his speech he asked me to say something to the team.
But I don't have any thought to say at that time. How can I cope with this situation and quickly make a short, crisp
, quick and effective speech. How can I find the content in my my at random or instantaneously at that moment of time.
